## Problem Statement 

__Telephone__ company, also known as __telco__, is a telecommunications providers that provides services such as __telephony__ and __data communications access__. They are mainly responsibility of providing the phone services to people in different parts of the United States of America. What makes things interesting is that there are a lot of customers who use communication services from Telco. There are customers who also opt for other services such as TV Streaming and movies streaming. 

Since __Telco__ gets a lot of customers who __subscribe__ to their service, it is handy if we are able to predict whether a __customer__ is going to __churn (leave the service)__ within a span of a fwe days. Furthermore, it would be great if we could consider factors which are __influential__ in the churn of customers such as the __type of billing__, __age__ and whether they have a __partner or not__. After taking a look at these factors and many others which influence customer churn, they might come up with plans that ensure that customers do not leave their services.
